It’s morning and the sunshine’s knocking my door
After the rain stops we gotta see the rainbow 
It’s a brand new day and I’m feeling just great 
I got you, I got you, you 
I dreamed last night our love was divine 
I wanna know how I can make it happen
Dreaming everyday as a part of a plan with you

Cause I’m feeling stronger when you’re by my side 
You’re my love, you’re the love of my life, my life 
Take my hand and hold me tight

I’m not afraid I know why you brought love into my life
Love will come and change your life and change your life
Don’t be afraid, give a try, spread your wings and start to fly
Cause we are one and we will dance into the light
Until the end of the time
Till the end of the time ooh, oh oh oh

Cause I’m feeling stronger when you’re by my side
You’re my love, you’re the love of my life, my life
Take my hand and hold me tight

I’m not afraid I know why you brought love into my life
Love will come and change your life and change your life
Don’t be afraid, give a try, spread your wings and start to fly
Cause we are one and we will dance into the light
Until the end of the tïme
